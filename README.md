The spectral product is calculated by multiplying H compressed versions of the spectrum. Let's call $f_k = \frac{k}{N_{fft}}$ the discrete frequency of the DFT, we have \begin{equation}
    P(f_k) = \prod_{h=1}^{H} |X(f_k h)|
\end{equation}
We calculate the DFT frequencies and amplitudes with the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm.



We then calculate the vectors containing the spectral product frequencies and amplitudes.

The F0 is the value that has the maximum amplitude y and the minimum frequency
