# Concept

The idea is to build a PureData "pipeline" for wav sample which will be processed. Some descriptors (pitch, loudness, etc) will be extracted from the wav sample and and 
fed the DDSP trained model. 
Sigmund function extract the pitch and the loudness

We will thus obtain an output wav in return which will be the original audio "timbre transfered" with the ddsp.
